# New \[SPOT_NAME\] spot illustration

I'm adding a new spot illustration to Stacks-Icons named \[SPOT_NAME\]. I've checked all of the following items necessary for merging this PR:

- Styles
  - [ ] all spots match the existing style conventions
  - [ ] all spots are in monochrome black/gray
- Regular sized spot **required**
  - [ ] my file is named `\[SPOT_NAME\].svg`
  - [ ] the spot has a height and width of 48x48 pixels
- Large spot
  - [ ] my file is named `\[SPOT_NAME\]Lg.svg`
  - [ ] the spot has a height and width of 96x96 pixels
- Extra large spot
  - [ ] my file is named `\[SPOT_NAME\]XL.svg`
  - [ ] the spot has a height and width of 196x196 pixels
  - [ ] a Lg version of this spot also exists
