# New ICON_NAME icon(s)

I'm adding a new icon to Stacks-Icons named **ICON_NAME**. I've checked all of the following items necessary for merging this PR:

-   [ ] all icons have been added to the source [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/NxAqQAi9i5XsrZSm1WYj6tsM)
-   [ ] icons do not contain any logos or other trademarked content
-   Styles
    -   [ ] all icons match the existing style conventions
    -   [ ] all icons are aligned _exactly_ to the pixel grid to prevent blurriness
    -   [ ] all icons are in monochrome black/gray _or_ in their native colors
    -   [ ] all sizes for this icon have a matching color scheme
-   Regular sized icon **required**
    -   [ ] my Figma component is named `Icon/ICON_NAME`
    -   [ ] the icon has a height and width of 18x18 pixels
-   Large icon
    -   [ ] my Figma component is named `Icon/ICON_NAMELg`
    -   [ ] the icon has a height and width of 36x36 pixels
-   Small icon
    -   [ ] my Figma component is named `Icon/ICON_NAMESm`
    -   [ ] the icon has a height and width of 14x14 pixels
