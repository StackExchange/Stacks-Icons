# New \[ICON_NAME\] icon

I'm adding a new icon to Stacks-Icons named \[ICON_NAME\]. I've checked all of the following items necessary for merging this PR:

- Styles
  - [ ] all icons match the existing style conventions
  - [ ] all icons are aligned _exactly_ to the pixel grid to prevent blurriness
  - [ ] all icons are in monochrome black/gray _or_ in their native colors
  - [ ] all sizes for this icon have a matching color scheme
- Regular sized icon **required**
  - [ ] my file is named `\[ICON_NAME\].svg`
  - [ ] the icon has a height and width of 18x18 pixels
- Large icon
  - [ ] my file is named `\[ICON_NAME\]Lg.svg`
  - [ ] the icon has a height and width of 36x36 pixels
- Small icon
  - [ ] my file is named `\[ICON_NAME\]Sm.svg`
  - [ ] the icon has a height and width of 14x14 pixels
- Logos
  - [ ] my file is named `Logo\[ICON_NAME\].svg`
  - [ ] if my file is the glyph only, it is named `Logo\[ICON_NAME\]Glyph.svg`
  - [ ] I have done my best to match the sizes of existing logos as much as possible
